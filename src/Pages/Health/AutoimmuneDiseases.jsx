        Autoimmune diseases occur when the body's immune system mistakenly
        attacks its own tissues. There are over 80 different types of autoimmune
        diseases, affecting various parts of the body.

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple
        sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. Symptoms can vary widely depending on
        the specific disease but often include fatigue, joint pain, skin
        problems, and organ dysfunction.
