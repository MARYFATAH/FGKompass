        Endometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the lining
        of the uterus grows outside the uterine cavity. This can lead to pain,
        irregular bleeding, and fertility issues.

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Common symptoms of endometriosis include pelvic pain, painful periods,
        pain during intercourse, and infertility. The exact cause of
        endometriosis is still unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a
        combination of genetic, hormonal, and immune system factors.
